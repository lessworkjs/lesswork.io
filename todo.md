# TO-DO

## deploy
* need some stuff to help deploys

## vendor publish
* copy configs, or w/e, from vendors, like laravel

## dynamodb
* good for default configuration examples

## auth: jwt, get token
* create a post route example that returns a valid token 
* make a APP_KEY generator 


## adonis orm commands
* implement the seed and migration commands

I tried but the commands are not static, so they fail to load. Would require local clone.



## mocks
* testing and stuff..


## translations 
* nothing fancy, resources/lang folder like laravel
